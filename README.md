# About 5Words
This Project enables users to have a decentralized mailbox that they own(not tied to any provider), have control over(whitelist based).

## What does my address look like?
Instead of having an address like johndoe@example.com you get 5 words from a word list with ~7000 words.

So your new address could look like this: **bagel cold image jet omega**

This also means, you can create as many addresses as you like and your address is not tied to any provider like @example.com.
